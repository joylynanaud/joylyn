                <p> A family is God's greatest gift to all living beings on earth including human beings. 
                    A person without family and its love is never complete and happy. 
                    A family is one with whom you can share all your joys and sorrows. 
                    Family stands by you at the toughest situations in life.
                     </br></br>
                     Family gives you the warmth and affection that you may not get anywhere else. 
                    I too am blessed with such a family. My family has always been my strength. 
                    My mother, father, sister and I complete my family.

                    <h2>Think To Know About Love</h2>
                    <p> Love is an emotion that makes us feel so many things. 
                        It's the butterflies in our stomachs, our hearts beating fast in our chests and 
                        our palms sweating whenever that special someone is near. With that said, it can 
                        often be difficult to articulate just how much a loved one means to you. 
                        That's exactly why we created this list of the best love quotes to help you find a 
                        beautiful way to tell the person who has your heart exactly how much you care.</p>
